Console manipulation for F#

Some experiments in a console library for F#.
Uses an approach to layout UI inspired by the React family of HTML/JS libraries. It's not a virtual DOM but it's structural
as opposed to explicitly calling writes.

Updated to run .NET Core 3.0

An interesting library to use as inspriation is [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm), billed as
usable for creating cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) TUIs.
